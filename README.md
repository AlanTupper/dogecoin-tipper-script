dogecoin-tipper-script
======================

A simple LSL script for tipping Dogecoin in Opensimulator and Second Life

To use, drop into any object you want to act as a tipjar or similar tip-device.  

Requires a Notecard named "Address" that contains only a valid Dogecoin address.  The script will do some basic validation, but won't catch anything beyond the barebones.  

Once it's configured, anyone who touches the object will get a menu to load a page to the address QR code.  Right now this is just a Google Charts hack, so there's nothing special happening on the page.


To the Moon!
